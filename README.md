backupManager
=============

Simple Backup Manager and Automater designed for my network.  Incomplete.

Currently has a GUI that lets a user choose the files to back up, but right now only indexes those files.
compareIndexes.py already retrieves the index info; all that is left to finish of the core functionality is the actual backing up.
